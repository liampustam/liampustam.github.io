        <h4>About Me</h4>
        I began to like technology when I was little, my first obsseion was phones and how they work, this inspired my curiosty about computers, the internet and anything that involves it. I joined a computer science class in my freshman year of college and learned a little bit about  coding. In my 2nd year of highschool I saw the STEAM application and saw fullstack development and instantly knew I wanted to do it.
